# UWP
[UWP](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/index) 是 Universal Windows Platform，它可用一個程式碼來開發所有Windows 裝置(包括PC、平板、手機、XBox、IoT、Surface Hub、HoloLens，作業系統為Windows 10)都可執行的程式。

開發語言可以是 C#、C++/CX、[C++/WinRT](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/)、Visual Basic、Javascript。

功能如下：

* **Secure: UWP apps declare which device resources and data they access. The user must authorize that access.**
* Able to use a common API on all devices that run Windows 10.
* Able to use device specific capabilities and adapt the UI to different device screen sizes, resolutions, and DPI.
* Available from the Microsoft Store on all devices (or only those that you specify) that run on Windows 10. The Microsoft Store provides multiple ways to make money on your app.
* Able to be installed and uninstalled without risk to the machine or incurring "machine rot".
* Engaging: use live tiles, push notifications, and user activities that interact with Windows Timeline and Cortana's Pick Up Where I Left Off, to engage users.
* Programmable in C#, C++, Visual Basic, and Javascript. For UI, use XAML, HTML, or DirectX.
